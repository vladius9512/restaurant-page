# restaurant-page Project

## [Live Demo](https://vladius9512.github.io/restaurant-page/)

An assignment from The Odin Project

### What I learned?

* Was the first time I used NPM in this project
* The challenge was to use only javascript and as little HTML as possible so I could practice my dom manipulation
* How to import and export functions in different files and how to simplify some functions.
* That I should complete the readme file exactly after I finish the project, or my memory might forget what I learned during a project assignment
